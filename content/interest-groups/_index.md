There may be nothing to satisfy your hacking urges in the regular ol' mods offered by NUS. That's why student groups have formed these interest groups to spur hacker culture within NUS. These interest groups hold events on a regularly basis, including hackathons. Do join them if you want to be a part of NUS' hacker culture!
