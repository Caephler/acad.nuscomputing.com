If you have downloaded and installed SSH Secure Shell on your local machine, you may double click on the **SSH Secure File Transfer** icon  on the desktop.

Or if you have already logged into your UNIX account, you may click on the similar yellow icon as circled below to open the **File Transfer** program.

- On the left window panel, the contents of the PC is shown.
- On the right window panel, the Sunfire home directory is shown.

You can navigate around both panels to copy/delete files.

To transfer a file, click on it and drag it to the other panel.
