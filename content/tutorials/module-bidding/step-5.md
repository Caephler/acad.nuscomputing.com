# [Centralised Online Undergraduates Registration System (CORS)](http://www.nus.edu.sg/cors/index.html)

A system for NUS students to bid for modules, ballot for tutorial slots and also to declare your minor etc.

## [CORS Schedule](http://www.cors.nus.edu.sg/schedule.html)

There are different rounds allocated to different groups of people! So do check out the dates for the different rounds!
Freshmen can bid during a special round 1C where they are shielded from the seniors overwhelming bidding power!
