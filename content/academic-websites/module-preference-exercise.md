## MPE queries

Please use your NUS email account and send an email to Miss Toh Mui Kiat at [comtohmk@nus.edu.sg](mailto:comtohmk@nus.edu.sg) with the information below:
- Full Name
- Matric Card number (not your NUSNET ID)
- Programme of Study you are in.
- Other relevant information (e.g. module code)

If you have any problems with indicating your module preference in MPE during this period due to technical problems, please drop an email to Miss Toh Mui Kiat at [comtohmk@nus.edu.sg](mailto:comtohmk@nus.edu.sg) before MPE ends.

Please make sure that you indicate the correct module type code for your module preferences. MPE algorithm only allocates modules that satisfy programme requirements. Hence, Unrestricted Electives will not be allocated.

Do remember to keep a copy of your MPE indication/outcome in case of discrepancy. UG office will preallocate successful ones to CORS based on all conditions met (no clashes in exam and class time-tables between modules to be preallocated, module prerequisites satisfied, modules preclusions are not done, average workload before CORS round 3A complied with, etc.)

Please avoid sending multiple emails of the same query to UG staff or department secretaries or faculty members.
