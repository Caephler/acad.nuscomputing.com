# [Past Year Exam Papers](http://libportal.nus.edu.sg/frontend/exam-papers)

NUS Libraries provide access to the Examination Papers (EXAM) database which consists of past examination papers (not midterms, quizzes etc) that were released by the Registrar’s Office.

The database is updated whenever the Library receives new examination papers from the Registrar’s Office.

The access to the database is restricted to NUS staff and students only.

*Tip: Check with your lecturer to see if your answers for the exam papers are acceptable.*
