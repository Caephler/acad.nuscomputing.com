Every year, the Orbital programme provides first-year students the opportunity to learn independently and craft a useful product during the summer holidays.

This is a 4 modular credit (MC) module that is graded “Completed Satisfactory / Completed Unsatisfactory” (CS/CU) under the Unrestricted Electives (UE) component. Upon completion of the program, these will be reflected in the transcript:

> Module code – CP3108B

> Module name – Independent Work

> Grade – Either CS or CU.

There are three different levels of achievement that Orbital programme recognises for the teams to work towards. They are:

| Difficulty                    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
